# Strategic Content Operating System (SCOS)

WordPress MU plugin stack that implements the [Website-First Blueprint](https://github.com/brighterwebsites/brighter-frameworks-docs) and [ALTC](https://brighterwebsites.com.au/altc-framework/) at the infrastructure level — content strategy, SEO, schema, evidence relationships, analytics, and amplification built into how the site runs.

**Repository:** `wp-scos-strategic-content-operating-system`  
**Status:** Production — deployed across managed client sites  
**Components:** `site-essentials/` (modular, current) + `brighter-core/` (legacy, migrating)

## Documentation

**Primary documentation (module guides, overview, stack):**  
👉 **[brighterwebsites.com.au/software/scos/](https://brighterwebsites.com.au/software/scos/)**

Per-module pages are being published there (SEO, Content Architecture, Custom Posts, Social Amplification, Analytics, Schema, Business Info, WordPress Tweaks).

**Framework concepts (ALTC, WFB, terminology):**  
[brighter-frameworks-docs](https://github.com/brighterwebsites/brighter-frameworks-docs) — separate repo, strategy SSOT.

**Developer notes in this repo:**  
- `CLAUDE.md` — standing dev instructions, module map, meta key conventions  
- `docs/` — implementation plans and module specs (not client-facing)  
- Local dev library index (`000-SCOS-Development-Library-Index.md`) — gitignored; agency-internal only

## What SCOS does

A Strategic Content Operating System is website infrastructure where content strategy, technical SEO, structured data, evidence, and amplification are **structural** — not bolted on via separate tools and manual processes.

This repo is Brighter Websites' implementation: a deployable MU plugin foundation for local service sites that need growth infrastructure, not brochureware.

**What that means in practice:**
- Per-page strategy is machine-readable ([Content Architecture Record / CAR](#content-architecture-record-car))
- Technical SEO is handled in-plugin (meta, canonicals, robots, sitemaps, archive control)
- Schema is generated from data already captured elsewhere
- Evidence layer CPTs (Reviews, Projects, FAQ) support E-E-A-T architecture
- GA4 reads CAR data for cluster/topic/maturity dimensions
- WP-CLI + MCP agents can read and write SCOS fields directly

**Rule of thumb:** New features go in `site-essentials/` unless a genuine migration-cost exception applies. See `CLAUDE.md` and `.cursor/rules/scos-refactor-first.mdc`.

## Content Architecture Record (CAR)
On singular pages (when Content Architecture module is active), SCOS injects:
```javascript
window.scosCAR = {
  car: {
    cluster, topic,           // scos_content_cluster / scos_topic taxonomies
    maturity, intent, purpose, // scos_ca_* post meta
    "search-intent",          // Intent_Goal_Resolver (FAQ link or scos_ca_intent_goal)
    pillar, service_pathway,  // scos_ca_pillar_page_id, scos_ca_service_pathway_id
    metrics                   // scos_ca_* analysis fields (auto on save)
  },
  meta: { post_id, post_type, scos_version, car_generated }
};

GA4 custom dimensions consume this data. Legacy bw_* keys are still read as fallbacks during prefix migration.

Meta key prefixes: scos_ca_* (content architecture), scos_seo_* (SEO meta), scos_schema_*, scos_sa_* (social), scos_biz_* (business info). See CLAUDE.md § Meta Key Reference.

##Prefix migration
Authoritative new data uses scos_* keys. brighter-core dual-writes to legacy bw_* where needed. Do not create new bw_* keys.
Migration tooling (archive/scos-migration.php) has been retired — sites migrate via WP-CLI/MCP field writes.

##Stack & compatibility
Built for:

WordPress MU plugin deployment (CyberPanel / LiteSpeed)
Breakdance (themeless builder)
GA4 (custom event seeding from CAR)
WP-CLI + MCP (Claude CLI agent access to fields)
GitHub → server deploy (agency workflow)
SEOPress field management is superseded by SCOS SEO Meta; SEOPress may still be present on some sites during transition.

##AI / MCP access
SCOS is designed MCP-first: business logic in reusable classes, callable from admin UI, REST API, and WP-CLI.

REST: brighter-core/v1/ (token auth via X-Brighter-Token)
WP-CLI MCP: external server config per site (see SEO Command Center tools/wp-mcp-server/)
Key endpoint: /scos — returns CAR-shaped data for any URL or post ID
Production sites
Deployed on managed Brighter Websites client infrastructure, 
SCOS is proprietary agency infrastructure. For documentation corrections or module guides, see the SCOS documentation hub.
